We understand it. Wether\n          looking for free bookings and reservation, or paid, you still need to\n          have some software in your website, blog, social media to let people\n          get your product and avoid too many phone calls.{' '}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A clear way of understanding how to get the service, and how to make\n          an appointment is crucial to avoid further issues with\n          misunderstandings, collision in meetings and so on.{' '}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          To implement a booking service for your website, you don’t need to\n          write a line of code even. Just put “PixelPlux Calendar” embedded\n          code/link to your website and let people use that.{' '}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Here are 5 steps to retain a reservation service for your website:\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>\n          <a\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n            href={SERVICE_SIGNUP_URL}\n          >\n            Signup for PixelPlux Calendar\n          </a>{' '}\n          – Free!\n        </h2>\n\n        <p>\n          First you need an account to manage all of your campaigns.

The reason you can create multiple\n          calendars is, you can have multiple services or even managing a team.\n          Let’s say you have 5 different type of tours in your boat agency for\n          each boat and you don’t want mess things up together.\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"docs-image-view \">\n          <img\n            alt=\"Create new booking campaign\"\n            src={require('../assets/create-a-new-campaign.png')}\n          />\n        </div>\n\n        <h2>Fill information about campaign and appointments</h2>\n\n        <p>\n          Now you should write your campaign title, for example: “Boat Mok 707\n          rental” or “Getting legal advice”. You can also type in a description.\n          After that, click or press “Create the booking”.

Click on “Insert single appointment”. try to fill\n          the modal, and create your appointment based on start and end time.\n          Also you can specify how many people can attend, since there is an\n          option multiple people will be attending if you specify any number\n          more than 1.\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"docs-image-view \">\n          <img\n            alt=\"Setup appointment for your campaign\"\n            src={require('../assets/setup-appointment-calendar.png')}\n          />\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          <strong>\n            It’s important to notice the Capacity of a campaign means how many\n            different people can book.\n          </strong>{' '}\n          Don’t mistake this with your internal service capacity.

If you set an appointment for more, there\n          will be possibly two or more different people will book it at the same\n          time – this option is useful for group tours, tickets or other group\n          activities.\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"docs-image-view small\">\n          <img\n            alt=\"Appointment modal\"\n            src={require('../assets/fill-appointment-modal.png')}\n          />\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          The price fields is also there for you to mention how much of booking\n          this session might cost.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n          AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER. Please Read This Provision\n          Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights. This provision facilitates\n          the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute (with the exception\n          of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that\n          may arise between you and us. Effectively, then, “dispute” is given\n          the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims\n          against other parties relating to services or products provided or\n          billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or\n          third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the\n          same proceeding. This provision provides that all disputes between you\n          and us will be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of\n          these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation claims\n          and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. We prefer this\n          because we believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation.\n          To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court\n          review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow\n          this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court\n          (including attorney’s fees). YOU AND {BrandName} AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS\n          PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER\n          PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN\n          THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING\n          ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</h2>\n        <p>\n          For all disputes, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the\n          dispute which is first done by e-mailing us at support@{BrandName}.com\n          the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a\n          written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the\n          specific relief you seek. If we do not resolve the dispute within 45\n          days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue your\n          dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your dispute in a court only\n          under the circumstances described below.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Arbitration Procedures</h2>\n        <p>\n          If this provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided\n          above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or we may initiate\n          arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”),\n          www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes,\n          and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The\n          arbitration will be commenced as an individual arbitration, and will\n          in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. This provision\n          governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration\n          rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules\n          apply to the arbitration. Because this Website and these Terms concern\n          interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the\n          arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply\n          applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable\n          statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. You or we may\n          initiate arbitration in either Georgia or the federal judicial\n          district that includes your billing address. In the event that you\n          select the latter, we may transfer the arbitration to Georgia so long\n          as we agree to pay any additional fees or costs which the arbitrator\n          determines you incur as a result of the transfer. So long as you place\n          a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, we will\n          pay all arbitration fees and associated costs and expenses. But, you\n          will still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that you\n          incur in the arbitration which include but are not limited to\n          attorneys’ fees or expert witnesses.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Class Action Waiver</h2>\n        <p>\n          Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not\n          consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise\n          preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or\n          claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private\n          attorney general action) unless both you and {BrandName} specifically\n          agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose\n          to pursue your dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration\n          Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply\n          to you. Neither you, nor any other user of this Website can be a class\n          representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class,\n          consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied\n          with the opt-out requirements above.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Other</h2>\n        <p>\n          You understand and agree that by accepting this provision in these\n          Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a\n          trial before a judge in a public court. If any clause within this\n          provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found\n          to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this\n          provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect. If the\n          Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable,\n          this entire provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be\n          decided by a court. This provision will survive the termination of\n          your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of\n          this Website. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the\n          contrary, we agree that if we make any change to this provision (other\n          than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change\n          and require us to adhere to the language in this provision if a\n          dispute between us arises.\n        </p>\n        <h2>GENERAL TERMS</h2>\n        <p>\n          We think direct communication resolves most issues – if we feel that\n          you are not complying with these Terms, we will likely tell you. We\n          may even provide you with recommended necessary corrective action(s)\n          if possible. However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined\n          by us, may require immediate termination of your access to this\n          Website without prior notice to you. The Federal Arbitration Act,\n          Georgia state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to\n          the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms to\n          the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Except for disputes\n          subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to\n          these Terms or this Website will be heard in the courts located in\n          Fulton County, Georgia. Except as otherwise set forth in the dispute\n          resolution provision, if any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent\n          with applicable law, then such term(s) will be interpreted to reflect\n          the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. By\n          choosing not to enforce any of these Terms, we are not waiving our\n          rights. These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, End User\n          Agreement and the Data Processing Addendum (as applicable), contain\n          the entire agreement between you and us and, therefore, supersede all\n          prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements\n          between {BrandName} and you about the Website and our services. The\n          rights of {BrandName} under our Terms will survive the termination of\n          our Terms.\n        </p>\n        <h2>CHANGES</h2>\n        <p>\n          We may amend our Terms at any time by publishing revised Terms on our\n          Website and/or by sending an e-mail to the address you gave us. The\n          latest copies of our Terms will be posted on our Website, and you\n          should review all Terms prior to using our Website. Continued use of\n          this Website following notice of any such modifications indicates you\n          acknowledge and agree to be bound by the modifications. Therefore, it\n          is important for you to periodically review our Terms to make sure you\n          still agree to them.
