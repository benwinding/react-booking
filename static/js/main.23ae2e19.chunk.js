We prefer this because we believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation. To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.

Because this Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the arbitrability of all disputes.
